Customer Segmentation



In this I have worked on, customer segmentation analysis. The purpose of this analysis was to group similar customers together and understand their behavior, preferences and spending habits. The data for this analysis was collected from kaggle and it consisted of information such as customer ID, invoice number, description, quantity, unit price, invoice date, and country.

The first step in this analysis was to clean and preprocess the data. This included removing missing values, removing unnecessary columns, converting certain columns to appropriate data types, and removing duplicates.

Once the data was cleaned, I performed basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the variables. I also created histograms to visualize the distribution of the quantity and unit price columns and created box plots to analyze the outliers in the quantity column. I also calculated some descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of the numerical variables.

After the EDA, I moved on to the customer segmentation part of the analysis. For this, I used the KMeans algorithm, a widely used method for customer segmentation. The algorithm clusters the data into a specified number of clusters, and in my case, I chose 5 clusters.

The results of the analysis showed that the customers could be divided into 5 different segments based on their purchasing behavior. These segments were differentiated based on factors such as the average quantity purchased, the average unit price of the items purchased, and the frequency of purchases.

In conclusion, this customer segmentation analysis provided valuable insights into the behavior of the customers and allowed me to group similar customers together. This information can be used by the retail company to tailor their marketing and sales efforts towards specific segments, leading to better customer engagement and increased sales.

I hope this  was helpful in providing a comprehensive understanding of the results of my customer segmentation analysis.
